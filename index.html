    <p> My name is Sydney and I am a sophomore finance major at the University of Rhode Island. <br>
        I enjoy traveling, going to the beach, and spending time with my friends and family. <br>
        I have two dogs, Sailor and Scout. Sailor is a 2.5 year old black lab and <br>
        Scout is a 2 year old golden retreiver. I love to give them ice cream and take them on walks. </p>
